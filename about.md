title: About WASABI

Hello! And Welcome to WASABI. 

WASABI (Warmth Anticipation Sensation Aversion Body-part Imaging Study) is an fMRI imaging study taking place at the Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab (CANlab) at Dartmouth College. 

The studyâ€™s aims are to develop generalizable neural signatures to examine the effects of different modes of stimuli that vary along dimensions of: 

body-site location 2) incoming stimulation 3) aversive experiencing

In other words, our main question is: Can we develop neural signatures that separately capture body-site, sensory, and aversive components of incoming stimuli? 

Stay tuned to find out!!! ;)
