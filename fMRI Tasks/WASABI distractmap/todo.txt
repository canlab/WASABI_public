1. We may need to generate several unique orders that will be drawn at random
Edit the xlsx formats for real 1-back and 2-back tasks.

In between scans, make it a 10 second limit before doing continuing.

The 2-back task is flickering
-- there should not be a no response feedback for the second trial


Before Body site
"The tutorial is now over, we will now begin our scans, after which you will be instructed of the task assigned to you."

remove the 2nd block of 2-back, repeat 4 - 8 -4 trials.

2. 15-30 seconds transition messages (replace with experimenter pressing space)






Pain Trial - Rating Recovery Time (7, 12, 18 seconds)
Rating = 5 second limit
Rating - Pain Trial Time (7, 12, 18 seconds)




10 second stim that occurs after the first 2-second trial.


Gotta do something about the order randomization for each trial
