# Welcome to WASABI! 
This site is dedicated to the WASABI study. The aim of this platform is to closely document every step of the experiment and have everything in one place (recruitment, task description, task code, project planning, task analysis code, troubleshooting documentation).
# About WASABI
WASABI (Warmth Anticipation Sensation Aversion Body-part Imaging Study) is an fMRI imaging study taking place at the Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Lab (CANlab) at Dartmouth College. The study's aims are to develop generalizable neural signatures to examine the effects of different modes of stimuli that vary along dimensions of: 
 body-site location    2) incoming stimulation     3) aversive experiencing  
In other words, our main question is: 
Can we develop neural signatures that separately capture body-site, sensory, and aversive components of incoming stimuli?
Stay tuned to find out!!! ;)
